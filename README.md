The Fog is coming. WynnVista is a Minecraft mod designed to enhance the gameplay experience on Wynncraft by automatically adjusting the render distance of the Distant Horizons mod. Made for my modpack [World of Wynncraft](https://github.com/bob10234/World-of-Wynncraft)

## What's Up

- Automagically adjusts Distant Horizons render distance based on player location
- Remembers your LOD render distance and returns the DH config to normal when re-entering the Wynncraft map
- Decreases render distance when outside the Wynncraft map to improve immersion
- Configurable settings via Mod Menu

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Fabric Loader and Fabric API installed
2. Download and install version 2.2 or higher of Distant Horizons
3. Download the latest version of WynnVista from the releases page
4. Place the downloaded .jar file in your Minecraft mods folder

## Configuration

You can configure WynnVista using Mod Menu. The following options are available:

- Show In-Game Messages: Toggle whether to display messages when the mod enables itself
- Reduced Render Distance: Set the render distance for areas outside the Wynncraft map (12-36 chunks to avoid rendering issues)

## Usage

Once installed, the mod will work automatically when you join Wynncraft. You'll see a message when entering or leaving the main Wynncraft map area, and the LOD render distance will adjust to whatever you set in the config (default 16). Once you return to the main map your LOD render distance will go back to normal.

## Requirements

- Minecraft 1.21
- Fabric Loader 0.16.0 or higher
- Fabric API
- Distant Horizons 2.2 or higher
